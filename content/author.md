## Hi there

My name is PÃ©ter Szarvas, I work as a freelancer, as a fullstack developer in
Hungray. First I stared out wirh JavaScript/TypeScript and frontend frameworks
like React, Astro, I have built some projects with this stack. But over time my
interest is shifted to Go, and server driven, traditional server-client
applications. This interest led me to build Lytepage, as an alternative to
client-side frameworks, to have a simple tool to build static sites.
