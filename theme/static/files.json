You can serve them with go as\nwell:\n\nmake ssg: start static file server\nhttp://localhost:8080\n\nThemes\nYou can put you custom theme under /theme.\ntheme\n├── static\n└── templates\n\nPut static files like css, js, images etc. under theme/static.\nPut templ components under theme/templates.\nEvery theme should have the following templ components exported from the root\ndirectory of the theme, as you can see in the pages/page.go:\ntype (\n\tNotFoundPage func() templ.Component\n\tIndexPage    func(files []*pkg.FileData) templ.Component\n\tPostPage     func(post *pkg.FileData) templ.Component\n\tTagPage      func(tag string, files []*pkg.FileData) templ.Component\n\tCategoryPage func(category string, files []*pkg.FileData) templ.Component\n)\n\n\nYou need to implement a catch-all logic in you files server, if you want to\nuse the custom 404 (not found) page. If you serve static files via the\nbuilt-in make ssg command, this logic is already implemented\n\nSwitching themes\nYou should backup you old theme folder, before cloning or writing a new theme.\nTheme switching is a manual process for now, mabye should be improved in the\nfuture.\n",

First I stared out wirh JavaScript/TypeScript and frontend frameworks\nlike React, Astro, I have built some projects with this stack. But over time my\ninterest is shifted to Go, and server driven, traditional server-client\napplications. This interest led me to build Lytepage, as an alternative to\nclient-side frameworks, to have a simple tool to build static sites.\nContact\n\nphone\nemail\nwebsite\ngithub\nlinkedin\n\n",
